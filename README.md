## Challenge description
For this competition, the objective is categorize shopping trip types based on the items that customers purchased. To understand better what a trip type is: a customer may make a small daily dinner trip, a weekly large grocery trip, a trip to buy gifts for an upcoming holiday, or a seasonal trip to buy clothes.

Walmart has categorized the trips contained in this data into 38 distinct types using a proprietary method applied to an extended set of data. You are challenged to recreate this categorization/clustering with a more limited set of features. This could provide new and more robust ways to categorize trips.

## Data fields

Field | Description
--- | ---
TripType| a categorical id representing the type of shopping trip the customer made. This is the ground truth that you are predicting. TripType_999 is an "other" category.
VisitNumber | an id corresponding to a single trip by a single customer
Weekday | the weekday of the trip
UPC |  the UPC number of the product purchased
ScanCount |  the number of the given item that was purchased. A negative value indicates a product return.
DepartmentDescription |  a high-level description of the item's department
FinelineNumber | a more refined category for each of the products, created by Walmart
