## Challenge description
For this competition, the objective is categorize shopping trip types based on the items that customers purchased. To understand better what a trip type is: a customer may make a small daily dinner trip, a weekly large grocery trip, a trip to buy gifts for an upcoming holiday, or a seasonal trip to buy clothes.

Walmart has categorized the trips contained in this data into 38 distinct types using a proprietary method applied to an extended set of data. You are challenged to recreate this categorization/clustering with a more limited set of features. This could provide new and more robust ways to categorize trips.

## Data fields

Field | Description
--- | ---
TripType| a categorical id representing the type of shopping trip the customer made. This is the ground truth that you are predicting. TripType_999 is an "other" category.
VisitNumber | an id corresponding to a single trip by a single customer
Weekday | the weekday of the trip
UPC |  the UPC number of the product purchased
ScanCount |  the number of the given item that was purchased. A negative value indicates a product return.
DepartmentDescription |  a high-level description of the item's department
FinelineNumber | a more refined category for each of the products, created by Walmart

## Used Methods
We used the following methods for this project:

### Cleaning
Data was downloaded in csv format, which had 4,129 missin data in columns _Upc_ and _FinelineNumber_.
First off, the function *clean_colnames* formated all headers of the file (removed empty spaces and simbols),
then, the function *clean_data* formated string in observation, to lower case. 
   Used functions are in the -util.R- script.
### Exploratory data analysis
In this part, a visual analysis of univariate and bivariate data was made. It was easy appreciated that
_TripType_ 49 and 39 are the most common among others. Also, the most common days for buyers is 
_Sunday_ and _Saturday_; the day less "bussy" is Thursday.

Regarding to the _DepartmentDescription_, the quantiti of purchased items decay exponentially, and the three 
most common items are from _grocery dry  goods, dsd grocery_ and _produce_ departments. The most common 
quantiti of purchased items (independently of their department) is _1, 2_ and _-1_ items (returned). The most 
common product is categorized into _5501_ _FinelineNumber_.

The _VisitNumber_ is usually repeated in the dataset. It is because one person buys different items, so, 
there is an observation for each purchased (or returned) item. Onle two visitors treaded more than 150 items.

The most commom product has the _Upc_ of 4011. 

On the other hand, under the bivariate analysis, it seems that the _TripType_ of 40 is related to commonly
used products (e.g. from _grocery, grocery dry goods_ and _personal care_ departments). Also, on Sundays,
There is more variance in the quantity of purchased items.

The datased is plotted in the 03-eda.Rmd file. 

### Imputation
1,492 rows have missin data, under the columns _Upc_ and _FinelineNumber_; maybe, it is because those 
products are note registered in the database (correlation of 1 between those missing columns). 

Missin data was imputed using the library *MissForest* in *R*.

The code for this part is in the *02-clean.R* script.
